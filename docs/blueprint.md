## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#2E9AFE) to symbolize trust and reliability, suitable for an app that connects users for deliveries.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), a light scheme with a neutral tone that ensures readability and accessibility, helping to bring focus to the other elements.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to complement the blue, providing a sense of calm and efficiency for secondary CTAs.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. The combination of Poppins, with its modern geometric look, and PT Sans, a more humanist sans-serif, will maintain legibility in longer text blocks and other details.
- Consistent use of line icons to represent different delivery types, locations, and urgency levels.
- A clean and intuitive layout, focusing on a task-oriented dashboard for both senders and couriers.
- Subtle transition animations and loading states to improve user experience, offering gentle feedback during interactions.
